## About MACH

MACH is Toronto Metropolitan University's premier liquid rocketry team, dedicated to advancing aerospace engineering through hands-on research, design, and testing of cutting-edge propulsion systems. Our mission is to push the boundaries of student rocketry while preparing the next generation of aerospace engineers for careers in the space industry.

## What We Do

### ðŸš€ Liquid Propulsion Systems
We design, build, and test sophisticated liquid rocket engines including our flagship GAR-E and SPRINT systems. Our engines utilize advanced injector designs, precision machined components, and comprehensive instrumentation for data collection and analysis.
